# SezzleCalculator
This webapp's was built using Gin for the back-end and React for the front-end. Although I had never used either framework or library, I did a little research and found that they were a part of Sezzle's tech stack. I had been meaning to get my toes wet in both Go and React, so this was a perfect opportunity for me to do so. I genuinely enjoyed working on this exercise! It is being hosted at 

## How to use

Then, run the following commands:
